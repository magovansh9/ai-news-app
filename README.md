# ResearchAiD

ResearchAiD is a voice controlled AI assistant that aims to provide a faster and leaner research process

## Motivation

Often, during research we tend to have an invasion of ideas and information. Where do you start?? ResearchAid makes life easier!

Topic in mind -> ask ResearchAiD about it ->  ResearchAiD pulls articles from requested sources -> ResearchAiD reads and scrolls through article headlines -> ask ResearchAiD to open an article you like -> Research on!

ResearchAiD is voice controlled! That means, it does away with the laborious process of extracting information from credible sources and scanning through an endless list of articles.
